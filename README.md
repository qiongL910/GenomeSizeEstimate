# GenomeSizeEstimate
This package is developed for R programming course CPSC 499

This is an R package for the analysis of counted k-mer frequency from jellyfish count function. Functions from this package calculate the untrusted k-mer, trusted k-mer, the mean coverage of k-mer, and estimate the genome size based on the input dataset.
